            <br>
            <br>
            Before venturing into acting, Hashmi worked as an assistant director for the horror film Raaz (2002). During

        <p class="para">Hashmi married Parveen Shahani in an Islamic wedding ceremony in December 2006 after a six and a
            half-year relationship. The couple have a son, Ayaan Hashmi, who was born on 3 February
            2010. On 15 January 2014, Ayaan was diagnosed with first-stage cancer. Five years
            later, in 2019 January, Ayaan Hashmi was declared cancer free.
            <br>
            <br>
            While Hashmi's father is Muslim and his mother was Christian, Hashmi was brought up as a Muslim and says he
            is a "firm believer in God". His mother, Maherrah Hashmi, died on 11 March 2016, Hashmi
            cancelled one day shoot of his film Azhar, when he got to know about his mother's demise. He did not
            want to delay the shoot of Azhar any further and also wanted to occupy his mind with work. So, he returned
            to the sets the soonest he could. In 2016, Hashmi launched the auto-biographical book called "The Kiss
            of Life", which was based on his son's journey of cancer.

        <p class="para">
            Hashmi made his acting debut in 2003, with Vikram Bhatt's thriller Footpath. Co-starring alongside Aftab
            Shivdasani and Bipasha Basu, he portrayed the role of Raghu Shrivastav, a gangster. His performance in the
            film was appreciated by critics; Gaurav Malani described him as the "scene-stealer" and praised his
            mannerisms. The following year he featured in Anurag Basu's erotic thriller Murder with Mallika Sherawat
            and Ashmit Patel. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama said about his performance: "Emraan Hashmi is
            fantastic in a role that seems tailor made for him. Enacting the role of an obsessive lover with flourish,
            there's no denying that the narrative gets a major impetus thanks to Emraan's performance." Murder
            emerged as a financial success, with a domestic total of ₹250 million (US$3.1 million), becoming the
            ninth-highest-grossing film of the year in India.

            Emraan Hashmi is posing with Mahesh Bhatt
            Hashmi at an event with his uncle Mahesh Bhatt
            Hashmi next starred in Anurag Basu's romance, Tumsa Nahin Dekha, opposite Dia Mirza. While shooting the
            film, Basu was diagnosed with blood cancer, so producer-director Mahesh Bhatt completed it. Although the
            film did not succeed at the box office, his portrayal of Daksh Mittal (a young millionaire who falls in
            love with a bargirl) was generally well received. A review of his performance in BBC Online noted that he
            was "becoming fabulous with every film." Hashmi then took a supporting role in Mohit Suri's thriller
            Kalyug, alongside Kunal Khemu, Smilie Suri, Amrita Singh, Ashutosh Rana and Deepal Shaw. Based on the sex
            industry, the film depicted the devastating effect that non-consensual pornographic films have on the
            subjects. Hashmi featured as Ali Bhai, a man who runs a sex shop. His performance garnered positive reviews
            from critics, with Taran Adarsh writing: "Emraan Hashmi makes a brief appearance and the actor is, like
            always, highly competent." Kalyug was a moderate success in India.

            <br>
            <br>
            Hashmi's first film in 2006 was Anant Mahadevan's thriller Aksar with Udita Goswani and Dino Morea. The film
            was a profitable production, but met with negative reviews from critics. He next appeared in Anurag
            Basu's romantic thriller Gangster, co-starring Kangana Ranaut and Shiney Ahuja. The film was a box-office
            success, grossing over ₹190 million (US$2.4 million) in India. Hashmi received positive reviews for his
            portrayal of an undercover detective called Aakash; Rediff.com's Raja Sen wrote, "His character is an
            understated one, and Hashmi manages to keep it that way. There is no unnecessary bluster or melodrama, and
            he does a pretty believable job. There is something lazy about his acting, by which I mean he makes the job
            look easy." For the film, Hashmi received his first Filmfare nomination for Best Performance in a
            Negative Role. He then acted in the crime thriller The Killer (adapted from the 2004 film Collateral)
            and the romance Dil Diya Hai. Both these films failed critically and commercially.

            <br>
            <br>
            In 2007, Hashmi appeared in three films. He first starred in the comedy Good Boy Bad Boy alongside Tusshar
            Kapoor, Isha Sharvani and Tanushree Dutta. The film flopped at the box office and received unfavourable
            reviews. He then featured opposite Mrinalini Sharma and Shriya Saran in Mohit Suri's romantic thriller
            Awarapan. Hashmi was cast as the protagonist Shivam, a gangster with a tragic past. Writing for the
            Hindustan Times, critic Khalid Mohamed described it as "intense and believable". Subhash K Jha wrote:
            "... Emraan Hashmi is an actor who conceals more than he reveals on screen. There is an inherent pain in
            his personality that this film taps better than anything he has done earlier. This film marks the emergence
            of a major talent." His final release of the year was the thriller The Train, which also
            underperformed. Only Awarapan was both a commercial and critical success becoming the best film of
            his career.
            His only film in 2008 was Kunal Deshmukh's Jannat, a love story set against the backdrop of match fixing.
            Co-starring alongside Sonal Chauhan, Javed Sheikh and Sameer Kochhar, Hashmi was cast as Arjun Dixit, a
            bookmaker. His performance was appreciated by critics; Taran Adarsh commented that "the actor displays the
            gamut of emotions with aplomb, he changes expressions like a chameleon changes colors. Jannat is yet another
            turning point in his career." The film emerged as a commercial success in India, with revenues of over
            ₹420 million (US$5.3 million).

            <br>
            <br>
            In 2009, Hashmi appeared in Mohit Suri's supernatural horror Raaz - The Mystery Continues, alongside Kangana
            Ranaut and Adhyayan Suman. The film's domestic collection exceeded ₹340 million (US$4.3 million), and
            emerged as a success. Hashmi's portrayal of a painter attracted favourable reviews; The Times of
            India's Nikhat Kazmi wrote: "Emraan Hashmi is fast emerging as the Colin Farrell of Indian cinema:
            completely mercurial, eclectic and unpredictable. As the brooding, prescient painter, who paints death on
            his canvas and falls in love with one of subjects, he is suitably aggrieved, desperate and afraid."[36] He
            then starred opposite Soha Ali Khan in Kunal Deshmukh's Tum Mile, a love story set against the backdrop of
            the 2005 Maharashtra floods. The film performed poorly at the box office.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The following year, Hashmi featured in Milan Luthria's period action-drama Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai with
            an ensemble cast including Ajay Devgan, Randeep Hooda, Kangana Ranaut and Prachi Desai. The picture, which
            depicted the rise of organised crime in Mumbai, saw Hashmi play Shoaib Khan, a character inspired by
            real-life gangster Dawood Ibrahim. With a domestic revenue of over ₹780 million (US$9.8 million), Once
            Upon A Time in Mumbaai emerged as a hit, and received a positive critical reception.[39] For his
            performance, Hashmi earned positive reviews from critics and received a Best Supporting Actor nomination at
            the 56th Filmfare Awards. Blessy Chettiar of Daily News and Analysis described him as "top
            class". Komal Nahta remarked: "This is easily Emraan's best performance so far. If he is cute in the
            romantic scenes, he is believably tough in the action and dramatic scenes." His next release was Mohit
            Suri's action-thriller Crook, based on the violence against Indians in Australia controversy. However,
            the film performed poorly and was panned by critics.
